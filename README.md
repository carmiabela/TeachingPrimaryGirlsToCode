# TeachingPrimaryGirlsToCode
In this repository, I will add coding presentation that I've created. These slides will be those of which I've used to teach young girls in years 4-6 how to code using scratch. At the end of this young they will be all signing up for and submitting their projects into a coding competition called [IKCC scratch](https://www.ikcc.info/).
